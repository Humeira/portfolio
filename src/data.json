  "bio": "I was born and raised on the beautiful island of Mauritius. I enjoy creating things, and I feel lucky to do that in my work. I’ve spent nearly a decade building for the web with a focus on clarity, usability, and thoughtful design. I'm always curious about better ways to build. </br></br> These days, I'm the Lead Frontend Engineer at <a href='https://expat.com' target='_blank'>expat.com</a>, where  I get to create things that (hopefully) make people’s lives a little easier. </br></br> I tend to follow my curiosity down rabbit holes that often turn into full-blown passions, whether it’s experimenting with new productivity techniques, getting lost in literature, diving into photography, or perfecting my next cup of coffee.",
